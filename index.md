# Documenting my machine learning journey #

Hello!

My name is Lloyd. I'm a computer scientist currently working as CTO at [Backlinko](https://backlinko.com).

I started studying machine learning toward the end of 2019.

## My first project ##

My first project was an African Grey Parrot classifier (based on the [image classification lesson](https://course.fast.ai/videos/?lesson=1) in the Fast AI course). Using images scraped from Google Images, and curating them with a bit of domain-specific knowledge (having owned an African Grey parrot myself), I created a dataset of Congo African Grey and Timneh African Grey parrots.

I then trained the neural network to correctly identify the species of parrot with accuracy â‰ˆ74. Not groundbreaking, but I was impressed anyway!

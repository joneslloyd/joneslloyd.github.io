# Documenting my machine learning journey

Hello!

My name is Lloyd. I'm a computer scientist. I work at [Backlinko](https://backlinko.com) as CTO, but this blog is personal and not associated with my job.

I started studying machine learning toward the end of 2019.

This blog documents my machine learning journey.

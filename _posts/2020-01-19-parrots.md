## Parrots – My first project

My first project was an African Grey Parrot classifier (based on the [image classification lesson](https://course.fast.ai/videos/?lesson=1) in the Fast AI course). Using images scraped from Google Images, and curating them with a bit of domain-specific knowledge (having owned an African Grey parrot myself), I created a dataset of Congo African Grey and Timneh African Grey parrots.

I then trained the neural network to correctly identify the species of parrot with accuracy ≈74. Not groundbreaking, but I was impressed anyway!
